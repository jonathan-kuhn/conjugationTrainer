# conjugationTrainer
Trains the conjugation of verbes in different languages. (RN only french, but with a relatively small amount of effort this can be expanded)
Run it any way you like, making this thing run as a docker container is on the todo.
You will have to add a verbslist.csv with the infinitive forms of all your verbs or similar into the project folder, the conjugated forms are fetched from verbecc (check out the github, it's a cool project).
This project supports Present, Past (Pass√© compose), Imperfect and Imperative time forms.
