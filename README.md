# conjugationTrainer
<p>Trains the conjugation of verbes in different languages. (RN only french, but with a relatively small amount of effort this can be expanded)<br>
Run it any way you like, making this thing run as a docker container is on the todo.<br>
You will have to add a verbslist.csv with the infinitive forms of all your verbs or similar into the project folder, the conjugated forms are fetched from verbecc (check out the github, it's a cool project).<br>
This project supports Present, Past (Pass√© compose), Imperfect and Imperative time forms.</p>
