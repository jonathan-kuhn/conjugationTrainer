# conjugationTrainer

<p>Trains the conjugation of verbes in different languages. (RN only french, but with a relatively small amount of effort this can be expanded)<br>
Run it any way you like, making this thing run as a docker container is on the todo.<br>
You will have to provide a .txt or .csv file with the infinitive forms of all your verbs when opening the website. the conjugated forms are then fetched from verbecc (check out the github, it's a cool project).<br>
This project supports Present, Past (Pass√© compose), Imperfect and Imperative time forms. It supports reflexive verbs, both with "s'" and "se "</p>
<h2>Todo:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dockerize</li>
  <li>Show if a verb was predicted or not</li>
</ul>
